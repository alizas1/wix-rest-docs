## Member activity updates API

Member activity updates are embedded in Wix applications to enable more interactions for a Wix site's members.

## Integrations

Member activity updates are embedded in:

- Wix Forum: activity updates are available for new and unread posts, new unread comments on posts, and post since a user's last visit.

## Terminology

- **Member Activity**: a change in the Wix site, initiated by a site member.
- **Initiator**: The site member who initiated the change.
- **Activity**: The type of action that results in the change, e.g. a new blog post comment.
- **Resource**: The part of the Wix site that was changed, e.g. adding a new comment to a forum post. The post is the resource, identified by a post ID (unique in a given context).
