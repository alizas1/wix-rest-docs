| Account | The account between the merchant and the POS service provider. Each account has an ID that the merchant uses to connect to the POS service provider.<br> Note: For now, Wix supports 1 account per merchant. In the future, we will support multiple accounts, such as 1 account per configuration. For example, “TallOrders NY” could have an account with a POS service provider in NY and “TallOrders CA” could have an account with a different provider. |
| Configuration | Also known as a "location configuration." A merchant’s store, restaurant, or business as defined on a Wix site. A configuration can be a physical location or a “virtual” one, such as online. You can define settings for each configuration, such as the location and the catalog for the location. The Wix location configuration corresponds to the POS location.|
